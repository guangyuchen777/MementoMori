                      <h4>Test the Game</h4>
                      <p>While designing and building the game prototype, we focused on two performances:  the playfulness and the capability to assist death discussion. We tested on the groups below:
                        </p>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li class="list"> Hospice employees</li>
                            <li class="list"> Older adults</li>
                            <li class="list"> Mixed groups (such as families, people in different ages)</li>
                            <li class="list"> Youngsters</li>
                          </ul> 
                        </p>
                      <p>We found that <a style="color:#3a94e9;">mixed groups</a> and <a style="color:#3a94e9;">youngster groups</a> had the most fun in the game and were more likely to successfully engage in deep conversations around the topic of death. However, enjoying the product doesn not mean willing to purchase it. At this point we had no idea how to commercialize our concept.

Then we first thought about the <a style="color:#3a94e9;">insurance company</a> since they are closely dealing with death topic as our game concept. We presented our work to a big insurance company in the Netherlands. However, our ideas and values didn’t match with the insurance companies, therefore we need to chose another path.

                        <p>Under the guidance of a great coach from The Gate, we tried to interview different people in the Dutch education system.   
                        </p>
                        <p>We spoke to <a style="color:#3a94e9;">two organizations</a> that are active in providing educational tools for school teachers and children.  They noted that schools would not pay much for such extracurricular tools unless they have financial support.  If a video or a PDF can explain the topic, even if it's very superficial, schools are less likely to opt for tools that cost more time and money but are more fun.  We also learned that there is now a funeral museum that even offers free workshops for schools.  Our solution is hard to compete with something free.   
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, we also interviewed several <a style="color:#3a94e9;">primary school teachers</a>.  What they said was similar.  As much as they liked our idea, they told us the schools currently didn’t even have time to discuss extracurricular subject due to the curriculum delays cased by COVID-19.  
                        </p>
                        <p><a style="color:#3a94e9;">The schools attach importance to convenience, cost and time for extracurricular events, whereas our game focus on playfulness and in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, this was not a good match either.</a>

                        <h4>B2C Business Model</h4>
                        <p>After two B2B attempts without a clear business opportunity, we built a B2C business model for individuals (see picture below).  From the tests in Feb. 2020, we know that families and youngsters are more likely to enjoy playing the game.  However, we've come to realize that there are two issues that might prevent them from purchasing the game: </p>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li class="list"> <a style="color:#3a94e9;">The word "death" can't be emphasized:</a> if the word "death" is emphasized on the package, people immediately associate it with a negative emotion.  While the game is actually very light and fun, people may not buy it because of a negative first impression. </li>
                            <li class="list"> <a style="color:#3a94e9;">Replayability:</a> Death is not something you need to talk about very often.  It's hard to convince people to buy a game they would not play often.  </li> 
                        </ul> 
                        </p>
                        <p>To solve these two issues, we thought up the following marketing strategies (see visuals below):</p>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li class="list">  We will not literally emphasize that the game is meant to "talk about death," but rather that it is a subject that needs to be discussed whereas remain taboo in society.  We figured out that the name on the package could be <a style="color:#3a94e9;">"Things You Shouldn't Talk about"</a>.  This sarcastically piques the curiosity of potential buyers.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list">  With a few tweaks, the current game board and manuals could be used for other socially taboo topics, too.  Players can purchase <a style="color:#3a94e9;">expansion cards</a> to discuss new taboo topics.  The way this game is upgraded to a series is a much stronger reason to buy our game.  This approach also creates space for our future design and maintains a sustainable revenue.
                            </li> 
                        </ul>
